# Void analysis code

This repository contains various notebooks and scripts used with the void analysis (either in running VoidFinder or V<sup>2</sup> or in working with the output).  This code is much more customized to individual uses and is therefore not included with VAST.


## nb

The `nb` directory contains various iPython notebooks useful for visualizing the data and void catalogs.  This includes code to construct wedge plots.


## profiling

The `profiling` directory contains an iPython notebook written to visualize the results of profiling VoidFinder during development.


## scripts

The `scripts` directory contains various python scripts, primarily for running VoidFinder.  These are essentially copies of the sample `SDSS_VoidFinder.py` script provided with VAST that have been customized for other surveys.


## VoidFinder legacy

The `VoidFinder_legacy` directory contains the legacy VoidFinder code: Fortran, C++, and original C++ --> python conversion.
